      <p className='text-base text-black dark:text-gray-200/80 mb-5'>
        I'm Mike, a Front End Developer from the Chicago, IL area. I am
        experienced in designing and building user-friendly projects from the
        ground up and focused on finding new ways to solve everyday problems
        through technology. I am a fast learner, a hard worker, and a flexible
        team player who loves attacking new problems head-on.
      </p>
      <p className='text-base text-black dark:text-gray-200/80 mb-5'>
        In my free time I enjoy running and hanging out with my wife Jenni. I
        also play and write music, and my compositions and songs have been used
        by NBC, FOX Sports, A&E, Comedy Central, MTV, and others.
